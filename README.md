# RoboScientist

Our goal is to model the way humans investigate and understand the physical laws of nature and create an AI agent that would be able to behave like a scientist, devising hypotheses and performing experiments. We are aiming at creating a system that would be able to discover regularities in data and present them in human-interpretable forms, such as a symbolic formula.
